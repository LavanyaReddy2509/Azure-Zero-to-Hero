# Basics of Cloud Computing
# What is Cloud ?
The cloud refers to internet-based computing services that allow you to access storage, software, and processing power on remote servers instead of relying on your own local devices.
# In Simple Terms:
The cloud = Someone else’s computer that you can use over the internet.

# What You Can Do with the Cloud:
 | Service	    |      What It Means	  | Examples |
 |:..............|:.......................|:...........|
| Storage	| Save files and data online	| Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud
| Hosting	|Run websites or apps without owning servers |	AWS, Heroku, Netlify
| Computing Power	| Use powerful servers to do heavy tasks like AI training	|Google Cloud, Azure, AWS EC2
| Databases |	Store structured data online |	Firebase, MongoDB Atlas, Amazon RDS
| Software (SaaS) |	Use apps without installing them | Gmail, Zoom, Microsoft 365

# Benefits of Cloud Computing
✅ Access from anywhere
✅ No need to buy physical servers
✅ Scalable (can grow with demand)
✅ Pay only for what you use
✅ Secure and reliable (in most cases)

# What is Cloud Computing ?
Cloud computing is a technology model that involves the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, users can access and use computing resources, applications, and storage provided by either third-party service providers (public cloud) or their own organization (private cloud) through the internet. These services are hosted in data centers located around the world.

In essence, cloud computing can involve both third-party providers (public cloud) and an organization's internal resources (private cloud). The distinction lies in whether the computing resources are shared among multiple customers (public cloud) or dedicated to a single organization (private cloud). The flexibility of cloud computing allows organizations to choose the deployment model that best aligns with their needs and requirements.

# Public Cloud:
Who Uses It: Everyone, like individuals, businesses, and organizations.

What It's Like: Imagine a giant, shared computer space on the internet. It's like using apps, storing files, or doing tasks on the internet that anyone can access.

Example: Think of Google Drive or Amazon Web Services (AWS).

# Private Cloud:
Who Uses It: One specific organization or business.

What It's Like: Picture having your own personal, private computer space. It's like a digital clubhouse where only you and your team have access. Others can't just drop in.

Example: A company using its own server for all its digital needs.

# Hybrid Cloud:
Who Uses It: A mix of everyone, depending on needs.

What It's Like: It's like having your private computer space, but sometimes you use the shared internet space too.

Example: A business storing sensitive data in its private space but using the public cloud for extra storage or specific tasks.
