# IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS models in Azure

# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS provides **virtualized computing resources** over the internet. You get virtual machines, storage, and networking, and you manage the rest.

# Key Characteristics of Azure IaaS:

**Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
**Full Control:** Users have control over the underlying infrastructure, including operating systems and applications.
**Flexibility:** IaaS is suitable for a wide range of applications, offering flexibility in terms of technology stack.

# ðŸ“Œ Azure Examples:
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
Azure Virtual Network
Azure Blob Storage
Azure Load Balancer

# Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides a managed environment for app development and deployment. Azure handles the underlying infrastructure, OS, and runtime.

# Key Characteristics of Azure PaaS:
**Simplified Development:** Developers can focus on coding and application logic, while Azure manages the underlying infrastructure.
**Automatic Scaling:** PaaS offerings often include built-in scaling capabilities, automatically adjusting resources based on demand.
**Reduced Maintenance:** Azure handles tasks like patching, updates, and maintenance, freeing up resources for innovation.
#ðŸ“Œ Azure Examples:
Azure App Service
Azure SQL Database
Azure Functions
Azure Logic Apps

# Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS is a cloud computing model that delivers software applications over the internet. Users can access the software through a web browser without the need for installation or maintenance. In Azure, SaaS offerings include Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and many third-party applications.

# Key Characteristics of Azure SaaS:
**Accessibility:** Access software applications from any device with an internet connection.
**Managed by Providers:** SaaS providers handle maintenance, updates, and security, reducing the burden on end-users.
**Subscription-Based:** SaaS applications are typically offered on a subscription basis, allowing users to pay for what they use.

# âœ… Azure Examples:
Microsoft 365
Dynamics 365
Power BI (as a cloud service)
Azure DevOps (hosted)
