# üíª Azure Virtual Machine Types (Series)
- Microsoft Azure offers different types of **Virtual Machines (VMs)** optimized for various use cases. Each VM series is designed for specific workloads such as general-purpose, compute-intensive, memory-intensive, storage-optimized, GPU-enabled, and high-performance computing.

# üìä Overview of Azure VM Types
| VM Series	| Optimized For	Use Cases |
| :--------- | :--------------------- |
| B-series	| Burstable compute	Low-traffic web apps, dev/test |
| D-series	| General purpose	Web servers, enterprise apps |
| E-series |	Memory optimized	Relational databases, in-memory cache |
| F-series |	Compute optimized	Gaming, analytics, batch jobs |
| Lsv2-series	| Storage optimized	NoSQL DBs, high disk IOPS apps |
| N-series	| GPU-enabled	AI/ML, rendering, video editing |
| H-series	| High-performance computing	Simulation, fluid dynamics |

# üß∞ Detailed Breakdown of Key VM Series
# **1. Burstable VMs ---> B-series**
- **Description:** Burstable VMs provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline for a certain period. They are cost-effective for workloads with varying CPU usage.
- **Use Case:** Development and testing environments, small websites, and applications with variable workloads.
- **CPU:** Low baseline, bursts when needed
- **Example:** B1s, B2ms

# **2. General Purpose VMs**
- **Description:** General-purpose VMs are well-balanced machines suitable for a variety of workloads. They offer a good balance of CPU-to-memory ratio and are suitable for development, testing, and small to medium-sized databases.
- **Use Case:** Enterprise apps,Hosting websites, lightweight applications, or development and testing environments.D-series (General Purpose)**
- **CPU/RAM:** Balanced
- **Example:** Standard_D2s_v3,D2s_v3, D4s_v3

# **3.Memory Optimized VMs --> E-series**
- **Description:** Memory optimized VMs are tailored for memory-intensive applications. They provide a high memory-to-CPU ratio, making them suitable for databases, in-memory caching, and analytics.
- **Use Case:** Running large databases, in-memory caching, and analytics applications
- **RAM:** Higher RAM per vCPU
- **Example:** Standard_E16s_v3,E4s_v3, E8s_v4

# **4. Compute Optimized VMs --> F-series**
- **Description:** Compute optimized VMs are designed for compute-intensive workloads that require high CPU power. They provide a high CPU-to-memory ratio, making them suitable for data analytics and computational tasks.
- **Use Case:** Batch processing, gaming applications, and other CPU-intensive workloads.
- **CPU:** High vCPU-to-memory ratio
- **Example:** Standard_F2s_v2,F4s, F8s_v2

# **5. Storage Optimized VMs -->Lsv2-series**
- **Description:** Storage optimized VMs are designed for workloads that require high storage throughput and I/O performance. They provide high local disk throughput, making them suitable for big data and large databases.
- **Use Case:** Big data applications, data warehousing, and large-scale databases.
- **Disks:** High throughput and IOPS
- **Example:** Standard_L8s_v2,L8s_v2, L16s_v2

# **6. N-series (GPU-enabled)**
- **Description:** GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) VMs are equipped with powerful graphics processors, suitable for graphics-intensive applications and parallel processing tasks.
- **Use Case:** Machine learning, video rendering,graphics rendering, and simulations that require GPU acceleration.**
- **GPU:** NVIDIA-based VMs
- **Example:** NC6, NV12, ND40rs_v2

# **7.High-Performance Compute VMs---> H-series (HPC)**
- **Description:** High-Performance Compute VMs are designed for demanding, parallel processing and high-performance computing (HPC) applications.
- **Use Case:** Simulations, modeling, and scenarios that require massive parallel processing,Engineering simulations, molecular modeling
- **CPU:** High performance (Intel Xeon, InfiniBand)
- **Example:** H16r, HB120rs_v2

# **üßÆ VM Size Naming Example**
- **D2s_v3 breakdown:**

    - D = General Purpose Series
    - 2 = 2 vCPUs
    - s = Premium Storage Supported
    - v3 = Version 3
